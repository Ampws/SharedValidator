# SharedValidator
SharedValidator is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Opside platform, aimed at enabling individuals with limited funds, lack of suitable servers, or technical expertise to participate in validator node staking and share in its rewards. The project leverages the power of crowdfunding to pool resources, allowing community members to collectively contribute towards establishing and maintaining a validator node.

With SharedValidator, users can stake their tokens, combining their individual contributions to meet the required staking amount for a validator on the Opside network. By doing so, they become part of a shared validator node, which actively participates in the consensus mechanism of the network. The rewards earned by the validator node are distributed among the participants, providing them with a proportional share based on their contribution.

This DApp fosters inclusivity and democratizes the process of validator node participation, making it accessible to a wider range of individuals, regardless of their financial means, server availability, or technical proficiency. SharedValidator empowers users who may lack the necessary resources to independently engage in validator staking, allowing them to participate and benefit from the rewards. Additionally, it encourages collaboration within the community, leveraging the collective strength and expertise to drive the growth and security of the Opside ecosystem.

By joining SharedValidator, participants not only contribute to the decentralization and security of the Opside network but also gain the opportunity to earn rewards through their staked tokens. Together, we can build a stronger and more inclusive blockchain ecosystem by fostering collaboration and shared participation in validator nodes within the Opside community.
