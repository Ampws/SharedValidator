# SharedValidator
SharedValidator is a decentralized application (DApp) built on Opside platform, aimed at enabling individuals with limited funds to participate in validator node staking and share in its rewards. The project leverages the power of crowdfunding to pool resources, allowing community members to collectively contribute towards establishing and maintaining a validator node.

With SharedValidator, users can stake their tokens, combining their individual contributions to meet the required staking amount for a validator on the Opside network. By doing so, they become part of a shared validator node, which actively participates in the consensus mechanism of the network. The rewards earned by the validator node are distributed among the participants, providing them with a proportional share based on their contribution.

This DApp fosters inclusivity and democratizes the process of validator node participation, making it accessible to a wider range of individuals. SharedValidator not only empowers those with limited funds to engage in validator staking, but also promotes community collaboration and incentivizes collective growth within the Opside ecosystem.

By joining SharedValidator, participants can contribute to the decentralization and security of the Opside network while reaping the benefits of their staked tokens. Together, we can build a stronger and more inclusive blockchain ecosystem through shared validator nodes.
